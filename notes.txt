With basic preprocessing (just resized to 128x128): 
  VGG16: poor performance

  VGG11: better, but still bad on testing data (flatlined at 16 starting from epoch 4)

With more advanced preprocessing:
  Cropped to content and resized to 64x64
  Much better, but unstable?
    Stability increased by changing learning rate from 0.001 to 0.0001
